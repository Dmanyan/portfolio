This is a quiz make for everyday workers, who are to busy about work and remind your mood.
For the design part I thought about keeping track of the answers by numbers, which mean if you click the answer the result will be like 1 or 0 instead of good or bad, so that in the end I could use the average of the result to show the different end results.
